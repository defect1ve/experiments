TIMsplit

Given a binary file that has many TIM structures squashed in it, this program
parses them and writes each one into its own file.

This program was written to parse a file DUMMY.CDA found inside the Guilty Gear
(1998-JP) psx game. It has only been tested on 4bpp TIM files but it should work
on the rest too hopefully. ::)

Very much barebone, I'd love to improve it if I find more uses for it while REing
shit.

some ideas
- add a parser that works headerless, i.e. assume data[0] contains a TIM structure
  without a header, and parse from there. To be able to do this, the program needs
  to assume the bpp, so it should be a parameter passed by the user.
- add a parameter to dry-run the program without generating any files, only
  printing the structures.
